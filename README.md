# ChessEngineCPP

A simple and modular Chess Engine implemented in C++ that supports custom chess rules, piece behaviors, and user-board interactions.
The project focuses on core chess mechanics such as movement validation, turns switching, special moves (e.g., castling, en passant), and detecting check or checkmate scenarios.

## Features

- **Piece Movement**: Implements standard chess piece behaviors (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King).
- **Special Moves**:
  - Castling (with all necessary validations)
  - En passant for Pawns
  - Pawn promotion
- **Check and Checkmate Detection**
- **Customizable Board**: Easily modify the board dimensions and initialize pieces.
- **Unicode Display**: Visual representation of the chessboard in the console using Unicode symbols.
